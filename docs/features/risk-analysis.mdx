# Risk Analysis & Management

The Risk Analysis module helps you identify, assess, and mitigate potential risks in your programs.

## Risk Assessment Process

### 1. Risk Identification
Start by identifying potential risks:
- Technical risks
- Schedule risks
- Cost risks
- Resource risks
- External dependencies

### 2. Risk Analysis
Assess each risk using our matrix:

```typescript
interface Risk {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  probability: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  impact: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  category: RiskCategory;
  status: 'identified' | 'assessed' | 'mitigated' | 'closed';
  owner: string;
  mitigation: MitigationPlan;
}

interface MitigationPlan {
  strategy: 'avoid' | 'transfer' | 'mitigate' | 'accept';
  actions: string[];
  timeline: Date;
  resources: string[];
}
```
